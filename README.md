# Semester Project 2

My semester project at Noroff to make a website for a auction house. Users on this website can bid on items and add items to the auction for other users to bid on.

Check out the [Live Demo](https://clinquant-llama-b27d14.netlify.app/) here.

## Description

This project is my second Semester Project at Noroff where I was tasked to build a auction website with main focus on SCSS and Bootstrap. This was also a practice of setting up SCSS and Bootstrap to compile to dist folder as CSS-files. 

Brief:
An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.

When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.

## Requirements

> All API functionality is managed by an existing application. This project only covers the front-end application for the API.

### User Stories

- A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register
- A registered user may login
- A registered user may logout
- A registered user may update their avatar
- A registered user may view their total credit
- A registered user may create a Listing with a title, deadline date, media gallery and description
- A registered user may add a Bid to another userâ€™s Listing
- A registered user may view Bids made on a Listing
